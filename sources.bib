	abstract   = {Stockfish is a free and open-source chess engine, available for various desktop and mobile platforms. It can be used in chess software through the Universal Chess Interface. Stockfish is consistently ranked first or near the top of most chess-engine rating lists and is the strongest CPU chess engine in the world. It has won the Top Chess Engine Championship 11 times. Stockfish is developed by Marco Costalba, Joona Kiiski, Gary Linscott, Tord Romstad, St\'ephane Nicolet, Stefan Geschwentner, and Joost VandeVondele, with many contributions from a community of open-source developers. It is derived from Glaurung, an open-source engine by Tord Romstad released in 2004.},

	abstract   = {AlphaZero is a computer program developed by artificial intelligence research company DeepMind to master the games of chess, shogi and go.  This algorithm uses an approach similar to AlphaGo Zero.  On December 5, 2017, the DeepMind team released a preprint introducing AlphaZero, which within 24 hours of training achieved a superhuman level of play in these three games by defeating world-champion programs Stockfish, elmo, and the three-day version of AlphaGo Zero. In each case it made use of custom tensor processing units (TPUs) that the Google programs were optimized to use. AlphaZero was trained solely via "self-play" using 5,000 first-generation TPUs to generate the games and 64 second-generation TPUs to train the neural networks, all in parallel, with no access to opening books or endgame tables. After four hours of training, DeepMind estimated AlphaZero was playing chess at a higher Elo rating than Stockfish 8; after nine hours of training, the algorithm defeated Stockfish 8 in a time-controlled 100-game tournament (28 wins, 0 losses, and 72 draws). The trained algorithm played on a single machine with four TPUs.  DeepMind's paper on AlphaZero was published in the journal Science on 7 December 2018. In 2019 DeepMind published a new paper detailing MuZero, a new algorithm able to generalise on AlphaZero work, playing both Atari and board games without knowledge of the rules or representations of the game.},
